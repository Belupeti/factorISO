# factorISO
Standardised symbols for simplifying Factorio system designs

## Idea
The idea behind this project is to create a library of symbols to be used for drawing circuits in the game Factorio. The symbols are mostly based on the ones used in electrical and pneumatic designs.

## Future
For the future I'm planning on making a resource pack for the base game and maybe programs for parsing in-game blueprints to this format

## Misc
I make no money from this project
I'm bad at writing readme-s
